HOW DOES ONE DO GOOD RESEARCH?

5 points to keep in mind:
1. Provenance tracking: Make sure to specify the origin of the infrastructure for at least three different aspects of your research-- analysis commands that you run as part of your main workflow, data that's produced by these or other commands, and a lab notebook or other informal provenance capture mechanism for everything else, the miscellaneous little tasks that crop up during research.
2. Negative controls: Generate random data, null data, or corner cases containing unusual input,and test that the associated analysis doesn't produce anything interesting.
3. Visualisation: Take a look at the data going into and coming out of each computational step.
4. Standardized database: When ready to release data to a teammate, team, collaborator, or the public, best practices generally use a standardized database.
5. Controlled access: Take care of ensuring stable availability, controlled access if necessary, and intrusion detection or change prevention if necessary.

Now, no one will question your motive! :)
